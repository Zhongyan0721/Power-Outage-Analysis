# Power Outage Analysis

## Step 1: Introduction

â€‹Power outages have become an increasingly pressing concern due to their frequency and impact on modern society. Recent data indicates that the United States has experienced a significant rise in weather-related power outages during warmer months, with a 60% increase over the past decade compared to the 2000s. This uptick is largely attributed to climate change, which intensifies storms, wildfires, and other extreme weather events, placing additional stress on aging power infrastructure. Beyond the immediate inconvenience, outages pose serious risks to public health and safety. For instance, individuals reliant on medical devices such as ventilators face life-threatening situations during prolonged outages. Economically, power outages can be devastating. Businesses suffer from operational disruptions, leading to great financial losses.

This dataset contains detailed information about power outage occured across states in US. It includes data on the time & location of outages, environmental and demographic factors, impacted population, etc. Some key features include climate-related anomalies, population density, land and water percentage, and other attributes that may influence power outages. The dataset consists of 1,534 records and 56 columns.

By researching the dataset, we can get some insight abou the following questions:
- How have power outages changed over the years? Are they becoming more frequent or severe?
- Which states or regions experience the most outages? Is there a pattern based on location?
- How do climate anomalies (e.g., cold vs. warm) correlate with the frequency and duration of outages?
- Are there specific months or seasons when outages are more likely to occur?

In the predictive analysis of this project, I will predict the causes of power outage based on other related factors.

## Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning
To make sure we can modeling the data conviniently and correctly, we clean the data by the following steps:

- Replaced missing numerical values (e.g., MONTH, ANOMALY.LEVEL, OUTAGE.DURATION, CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED) with NaN for proper handling.
- Converted empty categorical values (e.g., CLIMATE.REGION, CLIMATE.CATEGORY, CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL, HURRICANE.NAMES) to empty string.
- Converted OUTAGE.START.DATE and OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE to datetime format.

### Univariate Analysis

Then, to get a brief understanding of the data, we explore if there's trend or interesting pattern in data.
First, lets take a look at the most common causes of major outages.

We also want to see if there's trend of outage over years.

### Bivariate Analysis

We are curious about if different causes of outage can have different durations. Lets plot their relationship using a boxplot.

### Grouping and Aggregates

Intuitively, in the same time period, if the anormaly level (the cold and warm episodes by season) is higher, outage might occur more frequently due to unstable weather condition.
We do a double grouping here and see if that guess is true.
<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>MONTH</th>
      <th>ANOMALY.LEVEL</th>
      <th>OBS</th>
      <th>PCT_LAND</th>
      <th>PCT_WATER_TOT</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>-1.6</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>93.88</td>
      <td>6.12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>-1.4</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>86.91</td>
      <td>13.09</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>-1.3</td>
      <td>14</td>
      <td>83.78</td>
      <td>16.22</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>-0.7</td>
      <td>33</td>
      <td>94.14</td>
      <td>5.86</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>-0.5</td>
      <td>38</td>
      <td>91.50</td>
      <td>8.50</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
The table shows a clear trend that with higher anormaly level, outage tends to occur more often.


## Step 3: Assessment of Missingness

### NMAR Analysis

One column in the dataset that may be Not Missing At Random (NMAR) is "HURRICANE.NAMES". This column has a significant number of missing values (1462), which suggests that missingness is likely due to the nature of the outage cause. If a power outage was not caused by a hurricane, it is reasonable that the hurricane name would be missing.

### Missingness Dependency

Since the column "CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED" has the most missing values, we will check its missingness dependency.
By running a permutation test, we get the following p-values:
<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>CLIMATE.CATEGORY</th>
      <td>0.178</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>CAUSE.CATEGORY</th>
      <td>0.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>RES.PRICE</th>
      <td>1.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>TOTAL.PRICE</th>
      <td>1.0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

Based on the permutation tests:

The missingness of "CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED" depends on "CAUSE.CATEGORY" (p-value = 0.0). This suggests that the likelihood of missing values in "CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED" is influenced by the cause of the outage. Certain outage causes may not require or report the number of affected customers, leading to systematic missingness.

The missingness of "CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED" does not depend on "RES.PRICE" (p-value = 1.0) and "TOTAL.PRICE" (p-value = 1.0). This indicates that the likelihood of missing values in "CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED" is independent of electricity prices, meaning the missingness is likely unrelated to economic factors.

The missingness of "CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED" may not depend on "CLIMATE.CATEGORY" (p-value = 0.178). This suggests weak evidence of dependence, meaning climate conditions are not a strong determinant of missing customer impact data. See the following graph.

## Step 4: Hypothesis Test

Null Hypothesis:
The average number of customers affected by severe weather outages is the same as the average number of customers affected by intentional attack outages.

Alternative Hypothesis:
There is a difference between the average number of customers affected by severe weather outages and the average number of customers affected by intentional attack outages.

p-value < 0.05. We reject the null hypothesis. Thus, it is likely that we can use the number of affected customers to predict the reason of outage.
