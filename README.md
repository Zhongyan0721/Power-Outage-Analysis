# Power Outage Analysis

## Step 1: Introduction

â€‹Power outages have become an increasingly pressing concern due to their frequency and impact on modern society. Recent data indicates that the United States has experienced a significant rise in weather-related power outages during warmer months, with a 60% increase over the past decade compared to the 2000s. This uptick is largely attributed to climate change, which intensifies storms, wildfires, and other extreme weather events, placing additional stress on aging power infrastructure. Beyond the immediate inconvenience, outages pose serious risks to public health and safety. For instance, individuals reliant on medical devices such as ventilators face life-threatening situations during prolonged outages. Economically, power outages can be devastating. Businesses suffer from operational disruptions, leading to great financial losses.

This dataset contains detailed information about power outage occured across states in US. It includes data on the time & location of outages, environmental and demographic factors, impacted population, etc. Some key features include climate-related anomalies, population density, land and water percentage, and other attributes that may influence power outages. The dataset consists of 1,534 records and 56 columns.

By researching the dataset, we can get some insight abou the following questions:
- How have power outages changed over the years? Are they becoming more frequent or severe?
- Which states or regions experience the most outages? Is there a pattern based on location?
- How do climate anomalies (e.g., cold vs. warm) correlate with the frequency and duration of outages?
- Are there specific months or seasons when outages are more likely to occur?

In the predictive analysis of this project, I will predict the impacted population of power outage based on other related factors.
